# Singularity Containers for Protein Prediction Models

This repository contains scripts to build Singularity containers for popular protein prediction models: **AlphaFold 3**, **Boltz**, and **Chai-1**. These containers are optimized for both **ARM64** and **x86** systems with NVIDIA GPUs and have been tested on such systems.

**Key Features:**
- **Cross-Architecture Support:** Provides definition files for both ARM64 (e.g., NVIDIA Grace Hopper) and x86_64 architectures.
- **AlphaFold 3:**
    - ARM64 support introduced.
    - x86_64 support.
    - Model weights **cannot** be pre-downloaded due to Google's Terms of Service; users must download them separately.
    - Requires local databases for full functionality (see "Database and Model Weights Download" section).
- **Boltz:**
    - ARM64 support introduced.
    - x86_64 support (pip installable, but container provides pre-configured environment).
    - Container includes pre-downloaded model weights.
    - Supports MSA generation via ColabFold API.
- **Chai-1:**
    - ARM64 support introduced.
    - x86_64 support.
    - Container includes pre-downloaded model weights.
    - Supports MSA generation via ColabFold API.

**Important Note on MSA Generation and Databases:**
-   **AlphaFold 3** natively requires local sequence and structure databases for its data pipeline. Users **must** download these databases separately (details below under "Database and Model Weights Download").
-   **Boltz** and **Chai-1** containers in this repository are configured to support MSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment) generation via the ColabFold API, offering an alternative to local database dependencies for this step.

## Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](Arch.png)

## Prerequisites

-   Access to a system with Singularity (or Apptainer) installed.
-   Access to the internet to download dependencies and clone repositories.
-   Access to a SLURM-managed cluster (if using the provided `build_container.slurm` script).

## Database and Model Weights Download

Each model has specific requirements for databases and model weights.

### AlphaFold 3
AlphaFold 3 requires large sequence and structure databases to function.

**Requirement (Databases):** You must download these databases separately.
**Recommendation (Databases):** Use the official script provided by Google DeepMind:

1. Clone the official AlphaFold 3 repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3.git
   cd alphafold3
   ```
2. Run the download script (this requires `wget` and `zstd`):
   ```bash
   ./fetch_databases.sh /path/to/your/database/storage
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/your/database/storage` with the desired location.

**Note:** The databases require significant disk space (~252 GB download, ~630 GB uncompressed). An SSD is recommended for better performance.

**Requirement (Model Weights):** Access to the official AlphaFold3 model parameters requires registration for non-commercial use via the [AlphaFold 3 Model Parameters Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWZAgo1aYk0O4MuAXZj8xRQ8DafeFJnldNOnh_13qAx2ceZw/viewform). Ensure you meet the terms and download the weights to an accessible directory path.

### Boltz
The Boltz container comes with pre-downloaded model weights (`ccd.pkl` and `boltz1_conf.ckpt`) stored in `/opt/boltz_cache` within the container. No separate download is required for the weights if using the container.

### Chai-1
The Chai-1 container also includes pre-downloaded model weights, which are stored in `/opt/chai_lab_downloads` within the container. No separate download is required for these weights when using the container.

```

```

## Building the Containers

The `build_container.slurm` script (located in the repository root) can be used to build any of the model containers on a SLURM-managed cluster.

### Using the SLURM Script (`build_container.slurm`)

1.  **Navigate to the Repository Root**: Ensure your terminal is in the root directory of this repository where `build_container.slurm` is located.

2.  **Configure SLURM Script**: Before submitting, open `build_container.slurm` and ensure the following placeholder values are correctly set for your cluster environment:
    *   `#SBATCH --partition=YOUR_PARTITION`: Set this to the appropriate SLURM partition/queue.
    *   `#SBATCH --account=YOUR_ACCOUNT`: Set this to your SLURM allocation/account name.
    *   *(Optional)* Review and adjust other SBATCH directives like job name, output/error file paths, time, memory, CPUs, and GPUs as needed. The script uses variables like `${MODEL_DIR_NAME}` and `${ARCH}` in commented SBATCH lines for job name/output, but SLURM typically doesn't expand script variables in these directives directly. You might need to set them manually or use generic names.

3.  **Submit the SLURM Job**: Use the `sbatch` command to submit the build job. You need to specify the model's directory name, target architecture, and the desired build directory.

    ```bash
    sbatch build_container.slurm <model_directory_name> <architecture> /path/to/your/build/directory
    ```

    **Arguments:**
    *   `<model_directory_name>`: The name of the model's directory (e.g., `alphafold3`, `boltz`, `chai_1`). This tells the script where to find the definition file.
    *   `<architecture>`: The target architecture (`arm` or `x86`).
    *   `/path/to/your/build/directory`: The directory where the SIF file will be saved. This path can be absolute or relative to the repository root.

    **Example:**

    To build AlphaFold 3 for x86, outputting to `/scratch/user/af3_build`:
    ```bash
    sbatch build_container.slurm alphafold3 x86 /scratch/user/af3_build
    ```

## CUDA Version Compatibility

> ⚠️ **Important**: The definition files may have CUDA versions hardcoded (e.g., AlphaFold 3 currently set to CUDA 12.6.0, Boltz ARM uses base Ubuntu 22.04 which is flexible but PyTorch is built with CUDA 12.8).

This might cause compatibility issues if your host system uses a different CUDA version. You have two options:

1. **Modify the Definition File**: Edit the `From:` line in the definition file to match your system's CUDA version:
   ```
   Bootstrap: docker
   From: nvidia/cuda:XX.X.X-runtime-ubuntu22.04
   ```
   Replace `XX.X.X` with your system's CUDA version.

2. **Use Environment Variables**: Override default settings when running the container to prevent CUDA errors.

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter CUDA errors, try updating your NVIDIA drivers to the latest version
- For memory errors, decrease the `XLA_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION` value (e.g., 0.75 or 0.5)
- Some systems may need to use `apptainer` instead of `singularity` command
- If you continue experiencing CUDA version mismatches, rebuilding the container with the matching CUDA version is recommended

## Running the Containers

Refer to the `%help` section within each definition file for architecture-specific instructions on running the built containers.

**General Execution (Example):**
```bash
singularity exec --nv /path/to/your/<model_name>_<arch>.sif <command_specific_to_model> <arguments>
```
